## Getting Started
This project is built using React.js and utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. The folder structure of the project is as follows:

The-project/ <br>
├──index.html <br>
├── public/ <br>
└── source/ <br>
......├──assets/ <br>
......├──components/ <br>
...........├──App/ <br>

### Prerequisites

* NPM to download all project dependencies
* Git to clone the repository

### Installation
1. Clone the repository in the terminal 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stente3/ReactTrivia.git

   ```

## Usage
To begin working on the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running the command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the application in your default browser, and any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the page.

Now you're ready to start working on the project! The main entry point of the application is located in the `src/main.jsx` file. The project structure follows a modular approach, with reusable components organized in the `src/components` directory. You can customize the styles of your components using the Tailwind CSS utility classes, which are imported and applied in the relevant files.
